The identification process is difficult due to extensive injuries to the victims' bodies.</p><p>On Oct. 5, a Russian Iskander ballistic missile hit a grocery store and a cafe in Hroza during a <a href=""https://kyivindependent.com/son-widow-of-fallen-soldier-killed-in-russias-attack-on-kharkiv-oblast-village/""><strong>memorial service</strong></a> for a fallen soldier who was being reburied in the village.</p><p>A week after the strike, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) named two Ukrainian collaborators who allegedly <a href=""https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-identifies-collaborators-responsible-for-directing-fire-in-hroza-attack-that-killed-53/""><strong>assisted</strong></a> Russian forces with the attack. The two are wanted in Ukraine.</p><p>The alleged collaborators are brothers Volodymyr Mamon, 30, and Dmytro Mamon, 23. Both locals from Kharkiv Oblast, they began working with Russian forces during the occupation of the area, the SBU claimed.</p><p>Following the region's liberation in late 2022, the brothers fled to Russia, where they continued collaborating with Russia, creating a network of local informants and other contacts.</p><p>The brothers used these contacts to identify Ukrainian troop movements or gatherings, which they reported to their Russian controllers. According to the SBU, they often used unwitting informants, whom they asked seemingly innocent questions. </p><p>The SBU alleges that the brothers explicitly worked to gather information about the memorial service for a fallen soldier who was being reburied in Hroza, then provided these details to Russian forces.</p><figure class=""kg-card kg-bookmark-card""><a class=""kg-bookmark-container"" href=""https://kyivindependent.com/every-family-affected-in-russian-stike-on-hroza-village-in-ukraine/""><div class=""kg-bookmark-content""><div class=""kg-bookmark-title"">‘Every family affected’: Devastated village copes with aftermath of Russian strike on funeral</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-description"">Hroza, Kharkiv Oblast - Serhii Pletinka rushed to the scene just after a Russian Iskander-M missile struck a packed cafe in the village of Hroza in Kharkiv Oblast.

      <p>Over the past year, allied nations Poland and Ukraine went from displays of enthusiastic support and gratitude to trading veiled accusations in the UN General Assembly.</p><p>When Russia launched a full-scale invasion, Poland took the initiative to provide weapons to Ukraine and called on others to do the same.</p><p>Poland's people and government hosted millions of Ukrainian refugees.

The full-scale invasion blockaded the Black Sea, which Ukraine used to export 98% of its grain.</p><p>From July 2022, a negotiated corridor let some ships through until Russia pulled out a year later, just when the quarrel between Ukraine and Poland was heating up.</p><p>In 2022, the EU opened solidarity lanes that allow the tax-free import and transit of Ukrainian grain. But instead of going to the Baltic ports and overseas, a lot of grain was sold in Ukraine-adjacent countries, Poland included.</p><p>Early in 2023, a number of Ukrainian neighbors, including Poland, requested a ban on cheap Ukrainian grain being sold inside their markets, influencing the supply and pricing.</p><p>The EU adopted the ban in the spring of 2023 but lifted it in mid-September to a burst of renewed controversy. Deal negotiations are ongoing.</p><p>But the most visible part of the scandal began with the back-and-forth comments by Ukrainian and Polish officials in September.</p><p>This reached a fever pitch at the UN General Assembly in New York, where Polish President Andrzej Duda likened Ukraine to a flailing, drowning man and said Poland needs to take care that it doesn't also drown mid-rescue.</p><figure class=""kg-card kg-bookmark-card""><a class=""kg-bookmark-container"" href=""https://kyivindependent.com/duda-hamas-attack-diverts-worlds-attention-from-ukraine/""><div class=""kg-bookmark-content""><div class=""kg-bookmark-title"">Duda: Hamas attack ‘diverts world’s attention’ from Ukraine</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-description"">Polish President Andrzej Duda believes the extremist group Hamas’ attack on Israel will contribute to Russia’s war in Ukraine as it will draw away attention from the conflict, he said on Polish television.</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-metadata""><img class=""kg-bookmark-icon"" src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/size/w256h256/format/png/2023/03/K-new.svg"" alt=""""><span class=""kg-bookmark-author"">The Kyiv Independent</span><span class=""kg-bookmark-publisher"">The Kyiv Independent news desk</span></div></div><div class=""kg-bookmark-thumbnail""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1676988608.jpg"" alt=""""></div></a></figure><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to imply that Poland was play-acting and treating Ukraine as would a tacit ally of Russia.</p><p>Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki then told a Polish interviewer that Poland is not transferring weapons to Ukraine, rearming itself instead. It was clarified that he meant there'd be no new weapons at this time and not no weapons ever again, but many people around the world had taken it to mean the latter.</p><h3 id=""glut-of-grain""><code>Glut of grain</code></h3><p>After the solidarity lanes opened, the Polish farmers were fuming. The country doesn't normally buy Ukrainian cereals, and imports increased 600-fold, said Daniel Szeligowski, an economist at the Warsaw School of Economics.</p><p>""Ukrainian grain exports have disrupted local markets,"" Centre for European Studies expert Tadeusz Iwanski said. ""For some Polish farmers, their work is much less profitable due to the inflow of cheaper, duty-free production from Ukraine. This is a real problem. And the authorities in Kyiv seem to not want to notice it.""</p><p>Some Polish experts are suspicious of Ukraine's larger agricultural corporations or traders that are richer and more economically resilient than Poland's smallholders.</p><p>At least 75% of Ukraine's farmers are actually small and medium entities. But Ukraine's top 14 wheat exporters also had 85% of the market in 2021.</p><p>Denys Marchuk, deputy chief of Ukraine Agrarian Council, which represents small and medium farmers, disputed Poland's version. He said the majority of exports passed through Europe — the amounts sold in Europe wouldn't be enough for such a dramatic price shift.</p><p>The Kyiv School of Economics reported that grain prices in Europe actually went up during this period. Polish farmers sell most of their crops inside Europe.</p><p>""Two interesting conclusions jump out from the price graph,"" KSE agriculture expert Oleg Nivievskyi wrote about these figures. ""The first is that Polish farmers are getting almost double their income. Everyone knows why. We're at war, logistics are expensive, there are risks and limited export opportunities.""</p><p>The grain situation was Poland's unpleasant reckoning with how Ukraine can come to be a competitor, not just an ally.</p><h3 id=""bitter-rhetoric""><code>Bitter rhetoric</code></h3><p>The snarky public statements by the Ukrainian officials certainly didn't help.</p><p>Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Poland blocking grain exports is ""an unfriendly and populist step.""</p><p>But it was nothing compared to when Deputy Economy Minister Taras Kachka used a modified historical slogan of Polish and Ukrainian solidarity to suggest that he was defending the interests of farmers from both countries. This slogan is widely revered in Poland and caused immediate outrage, multiple experts told the Kyiv Independent.</p><p>Ukraine's threats to sue Poland and several other neighbors at the World Trade Organization, and ban some Polish produce didn't warm any hearts either. Neither did Warsaw's counter-threat to expand the list of banned items.</p><p>""The ship is full speed in one direction,"" and that is not towards rapprochement, said Slawomir Debski, a political scientist with the Polish Institute of International Affairs. ""This ship could have been stopped maybe in July but we missed this moment.""</p><p>But Daniel Tilles, editor-in-chief of Notes from Poland isn’t sure this tension will derail a very strong relationship.<br></p><p>""I feel that once the elections are over, some kind of agreement will be reached,"" he said. ""A regular tactic by the Ukrainian government during the war has been to anger allies by saying they're not doing enough, which provokes anger, but it often leads to some kind of negotiations and support.""</p><h3 id=""role-of-elections""><code>Role of elections</code></h3><p>One thing Poles agree on is that the country is politically divided, with a closer race than usual.</p><p>The ruling party, Law and Justice, hopes to hang onto its seats. It's opposed by the more leftist Civic Coalition. Meanwhile, the far right, Ukraine-skeptic party Confederation, is enjoying a run of popularity.</p><p>Confederation is fighting Law and Justice for some of the same votes and has the potential to be a force to be reckoned with. The ruling party doesn't want the right-wingers in the coalition and needs to send the message that it will defend Polish interests.</p><figure class=""kg-card kg-bookmark-card""><a class=""kg-bookmark-container"" href=""https://kyivindependent.com/rising-far-right-pushes-warsaw-to-act-tough-on-ukraine/""><div class=""kg-bookmark-content""><div class=""kg-bookmark-title"">Far-right party may hold keys to next Polish government, sets tone in talks with Ukraine</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-description"">With the Polish parliamentary elections just around the corner, the country’s rising far-right threaten Poland’s relations with Ukraine in more ways than one.

But Siegien suggested that Ukraine may be paying attention to what she described as Poland's slide to the right and the likelihood of a more hostile government.</p><p>Tilles said it's possible Ukraine is thinking about the election outcome and how long support may continue with a conservative and a farther-right party in power.</p><h3 id=""public-emotions""><code>Public emotions</code></h3><p>Public sentiment matters more than policy though — the government is still chasing the emotions of the public, Debski said.</p><p>Last year's emotions were a show of unbridled support. This year revealed that things may be a little more textured.</p><p>Debski pointed out that the specter of history often hovers in the background of Ukraine-Poland relations. The Volyn Massacre by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army is always being talked about somewhere. There are always people pushing for things like the exhumation of bodies and recognition in the form of a monument. Kyiv hasn't done it yet.</p><p>Besides people with a genuine stake in the issue, the topic has been raised by some politicians, including from the ruling party, to score points.</p><p>As Russia invaded, these voices were drowned out by the rising tide of support for Ukraine. Polish people came out in droves to help refugees, put them up in their homes, and agree to a tax-funded assistance program.

      <p><em>Editor’s note: The location of the prisoner of the war detention center is undisclosed for security reasons. The Kyiv Independent got vocal recorded agreement from the prisoners of the war to be interviewed and identified in the story.</em></p><p><strong>Undisclosed location in Western Ukraine – </strong>Private Alexey Girkin massages his knee as he sits on a bed in the infirmary at a prisoner of war camp in western Ukraine, hundreds of miles away from the front line. </p><p>The former Russian inmate, who was an assault infantryman of Russia’s 61st Naval Infantry Brigade before being captured, spends his time at the camp reading pulp fiction and hoping to be swapped in a prisoner exchange.</p><p>Girkin had six years left to serve in a Russian prison in Perm Krai northeast of Moscow for drug dealing when a Russian army colonel arrived in May with a tempting offer: a pardon in exchange for six months of service, good pay, and generous benefits for his family in the event he died on the battlefield in Ukraine.</p><p>The Russian Defense Ministry began <a href=""https://kyivindependent.com/wagner-groups-conflict-with-russian-defense-ministry-worsens/"">recruiting inmates</a> for the war in Ukraine in early 2023 after the ministry itself stopped allowing the infamous Wagner Group to recruit in Russian prisons.</p><p>Roughly a week after being recruited, Girkin took his first-ever flight, landed in Rostov with other recruits, and headed to Russian-occupied Kherson Oblast for a short stop of military training before deployment on the Berdiansk axis, one sector where Ukraine has found moderate success during the counteroffensive.</p><p>In early June, just 10 days into deployment and over a month after being recruited, 30-year-old Girkin suffered multiple shrapnel wounds caused by mortar fire and was captured by Ukrainian forces near the village of Blahodante in Donetsk Oblast, <a href=""https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-liberates-blahodatne/"">liberated</a> just days later.</p><p>“I would go home right now if (Russia) would take me. I hope, believe, and wait (for the swap),” Girkin told the Kyiv Independent in the hospital wing of the camp with 33 other heavily wounded prisoners of war (POW) and several guards. </p><p>After Russian soldiers, mercenaries, and forcibly conscripted Ukrainians from occupied Donbas are captured, they quickly move through a series of detention centers in major Ukrainian cities before arriving at this camp in western Ukraine. </p><p>While it’s not the only detention center where Russian POWs are held, it’s allegedly the largest. Ukrainian authorities don’t disclose how many POW centers there are, nor how many Russian POWs are currently in custody in Ukraine. </p><p>A prisoner exchange is likely the next step unless the soldier is suspected of war crimes. If convicted, they continue serving time at the same camp, Petro Yatsenko, spokesperson of Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, told the Kyiv Independent at the detention center.</p><p>So far, Ukrainian courts have convicted at least 23 Russian POWs for violating the rules and customs of war, according to court records. Their prison sentences are anywhere between seven to 13 years.</p><p>Ukraine has secured the return of around 2,600 Ukrainian soldiers during 48 <a href=""https://kyivindependent.com/22-ukrainian-pows-return-home-in-latest-prisoner-exchange/"">POW exchanges</a> with Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion. </p><p>Kyiv, however, doesn’t disclose the total number of Russian POWs swapped, according to Yatsenko. The Russian Defense Ministry’s swap reports indicate that Moscow has brought back 1,220 troops with 20 POW exchanges since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. </p><p>In a comment to the Kyiv Independent, Andriy Yusov, spokesperson for the Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s military intelligence, confirmed that Ukraine has released fewer Russian POWs than Ukrainian POWs it has received in prisoner exchanges. </p><p>Girkin believes he has a good chance to be exchanged as investigators have not suspected him of carrying out war crimes.</p><p>“Over 99% of the POWs want to be exchanged to Russia. Those who do not want to be exchanged will remain in the camp until the end of the war,” Yatsenko said. </p><p>Those who don’t want to be swapped have either been forcibly conscripted Ukrainians from occupied territories or are former Russian convicts, drafted straight from prisons, who think they might be put behind bars again if they return home.</p><figure class=""kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/_MG_8490.jpg"" class=""kg-image"" alt loading=""lazy""><figcaption>Alexey Girkin (R) among other Russian prisoners of the war in a sickbay at the POW camp in Western Ukraine in late September. (Photo by Alexander Khrebet/ The Kyiv Independent)</figcaption></figure><h3 id=""arriving-at-camp""><code>Arriving at camp</code></h3><p>A white-tiled room with several shelves filled with labeled and tied white burlap bags is the first thing that POWs see after arriving at the camp. Newcomers receive prison uniforms and hand over their military uniforms that are returned if and when they are exchanged.</p><p>The room smells of the dirt and blood that remains on the stockpiled uniforms.</p><p>Yatsenko, the spokesperson, shows two pairs of leather boots, slippers, and two sets of uniforms consisting of blue pants, jackets, t-shirts, striped gray pajamas, socks, and a basic hygiene kit that all the POWs receive. </p><p>“We do not provide them with tuxedos,” he quipped.</p><p>The monthly budget per prisoner is around $270, according to Yatsenko. It includes everything – clothing, food, and medical treatment. For comparison, the official minimum salary in Ukraine is $180 per month, and the smallest pension is $81.</p><p>After arriving, the prisoners take a shower — sometimes the first in weeks — and get a haircut, if needed, in a room called the “barbershop.”</p><p>Local medics examine the POWs upon arrival, making note of any existing conditions or injuries, including checking their hair for the presence of lice, “so that later no one can claim they sustained any injuries while in the camp,” said Yatsenko.</p><p>The 3rd Geneva Convention text covers the corridor walls leading to the quarantine area, where POWs spend two weeks upon arrival. There are no bars on the windows, some of which are open to allow some air into the rooms.</p><p>Ordinary soldiers are kept separate from officers in accordance with international law. The amber-yellow quarantine room has space for 30 soldiers. Lined with two rows of wooden single beds, chairs, and nightstands, it doesn’t resemble a prison cell. The 3rd Geneva Convention prohibits the detention of POWs in prison cells.</p><p>Meanwhile, Russia keeps Ukrainian POWs in prison cells, often together with convicted criminals and in proximity to the front line – all of which are prohibited by the convention. </p><p>One example is the notorious <a href=""https://kyivindependent.com/olenivka/"">Olenivka penal colony</a> in occupied Donetsk Oblast, which sits just 14 kilometers away from the front line. In an <a href=""https://kyivindependent.com/prosecutor-generals-office-explosion-at-olenivka-prison-caused-by-thermobaric-weapon/"">explosion</a> in Olenivka on July 28, 2022, over 50 Ukrainian POWs were killed and over 100 were injured. </p><p>The quarantine room for officers is much smaller. Three bunk beds, six chairs, and a window with bars. There are no officers at the time. Yatsenko said they are “rare guests” here as most of the POWs are low-ranking soldiers.</p><p>""POWs are informed about their rights. But fear fueled by Russian propaganda leads them to believe they will be tortured here. However, after the quarantine, they come to realize that no one intends to subject them to torture, and they begin to behave brazenly,"" said Yatsenko.</p><p>Following the two weeks of quarantine, psychiatrists examine the POWs, after which they join the rest in the general camp, where they work and pass the time.</p><p>“Medical concerns may arise due to mental health issues. Some of the POWs come from Russian prisons, are drug-addicted, and require additional attention. Some of them have suicidal tendencies,” said Yatsenko, adding that psychiatrists and camp staff closely monitor at-risk POWs after the quarantine period. </p><p>The Kyiv Independent asked several POWs at the camp whether they had been mistreated. None of them said so, but guards were around during the interviews.</p><p>The first-hand testimonies of swapped Ukrainian soldiers and the media reports suggest that Russian POWs get better treatment in Ukraine compared to Ukrainian POWs in Russia. </p><p>In November 2022, a UN human rights agency <a href=""https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-briefing-notes/2022/11/ukraine-russia-prisoners-war"">report</a> documented POW abuses on both the Russian and Ukrainian sides, relying on prisoner interviews that revealed instances of torture and mistreatment. The report provoked anger in Kyiv.</p><p>In another <a href=""https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/coiukraine/23-10-04-OHCHR-36th-periodic-report-ukraine-en.pdf"">report</a> released in early October, the agency said it had observed marked improvement in the treatment in the camp in western Ukraine, notably increased portions of food, and the end of physical exercise as punishment.</p><figure class=""kg-card kg-gallery-card""><div class=""swiper""><div class=""swiper-pagination""></div><div class=""swiper-button-prev""></div><div class=""swiper-button-next""></div><div class=""swiper-wrapper""><div class=""swiper-slide""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/_MG_8535.jpg"" width=""1240"" height=""827"" loading=""lazy"" alt><figcaption>A Russian prisoner of war serves food at a POW camp in Western Ukraine in late September 2023.

Yatsenko said their presence is meant to debunk Russian President Vladimir Putin's claim that Ukrainians and Russians are the same people.</p><p>In his notorious 7,000-word essay from July 2021, Putin articulated his imperialistic vision for Ukraine's role within a broader “Russian world,” asserting that any notion of a distinct Ukrainian identity was artificially created. This line of thinking was one of the justifications for Russia’s full-scale invasion. </p><p>POWs form two rows before entering the dining area. A low porch leads to the entrance and a staircase, from where the scent of fresh food wafts down from the second floor. The prisoners go up the stairs with their hands folded behind their backs.</p><p>The prisoners are assigned to work six days a week, an obligation under the Geneva Convention. They are paid slightly more than $8 a month, according to Yastenko. </p><p>The 1949 Geneva Convention <a href=""https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/geneva-convention-relative-treatment-prisoners-war"">reads</a> that POWs must be paid a fair wage, but that at no time should that wage be less than a fourth of one Swiss franc for a full working day, which is $7 a month today. </p><p>International law grants officers the choice to opt out of working. Five POWs told the Kyiv Independent that working in the workshops isn’t too demanding.</p><p>The work ranges from washing dishes, cooking food, or baking bread, to assembling paper bags with the inscription ""Ukraine is my country"" or welding and crafting garden furniture. </p><p>Roughly a hundred POWs work in the largest workshop, which also serves as a bomb shelter. In a bright, white open space with large windows, prisoners wrap welded metal frames with plastic that will eventually be ottomans and sofas. The Ukrainian flag sways in the wind outside the window. </p><figure class=""kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/_MG_8646.jpg"" class=""kg-image"" alt loading=""lazy""><figcaption>Russian prisoners of war make garden furniture at a workshop in a POW camp in Western Ukraine in late September 2023. (Photo by Alexander Khrebet/ The Kyiv Independent)</figcaption></figure><p>They hardly talk to each other, carrying out the monotonous work with utility knives, metal hooks, and compressor stapler guns. Work stops twice during the day. The first time is for a minute of silence to commemorate those fallen in Russia’s war.</p><p>""Every day at 9 a.m., POWs pay tribute during the nationwide minute,"" said Yatsenko, a spokesperson.</p><p>There have been reports that Russian POWs have been forced to sing the Ukrainian national anthem or shout Ukrainian national slogans, which Yatsenko denied. </p><p>A UN human rights agency <a href=""https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/countries/ukraine/2023/23-03-24-Ukraine-thematic-report-POWs-ENG.pdf"">report</a> from March described a “widespread pattern” of POWs being forced on film to shout and sing slogans during the initial phase of capturing the Russian POWs. Ukrainian human rights defenders also <a href=""https://mipl.org.ua/v-rosijskomu-poloni-shho-vidbuvayetsya-z-ukrayinskymy-vijskovymy-za-stinamy-rosijskyh-tyurem/"">recorded</a> testimonies of former Ukrainian POWs recalling they were forced to learn and sing the Russian anthem every morning at the places they were captured. </p><p>Work comes to a halt for a second time at lunchtime. Gulag slang from the notorious Soviet labor camps era is still used in the dining hall. </p><p>A group of POWs serves “balanda” — a Gulag term for prison food, still used by Russian-speaking prisoners everywhere. The lunch consists of a vegetable salad, a thin pea and potato soup, porridge with butter, a meat patty, and several pieces of freshly baked white bread. All the food is slightly under-salted. </p><figure class=""kg-card kg-gallery-card""><div class=""swiper""><div class=""swiper-pagination""></div><div class=""swiper-button-prev""></div><div class=""swiper-button-next""></div><div class=""swiper-wrapper""><div class=""swiper-slide""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/_MG_8548.jpg"" width=""1240"" height=""827"" loading=""lazy"" alt><figcaption>The lunch in a Russian prisoner of war camp in Western Ukraine in late September consists of a vegetable salad, a pea and potato soup, porridge with butter, a meat patty, and several pieces of white bread.

The accent typical for Russian-speaking Ukrainians from occupied Donbas occasionally comes through.</p><p>Moscow has forcibly conscripted thousands of Ukrainian men from Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts for Russian regular or proxy armies. They are kept alongside Russian prisoners of the war. </p><p>Mobilization in occupied territories constitutes a war crime.</p><p>Some tables have crutches leaning on them. One pair belongs to Serhii Versdysh, a Ukrainian from Russian-occupied Horlivka near the city of Donetsk who joined Russian proxy forces on the first day of the full-scale invasion. </p><p>He ended up in captivity in early June after stepping on an anti-personnel mine, resulting in the loss of his right foot, he told the Kyiv Independent later in the day while in the infirmary.</p><p>After being captured, he was interrogated, sent through detention centers in Dnipro and Kyiv, and eventually brought to the camp in western Ukraine.</p><p>All prisoners are interrogated at each stage of captivity, including several times at the camp. Girkin, the captive from Russia’s Perm Krai, was lucky – since his arrival at the camp, he has been interrogated only once. </p><p>Versdysh from Horlivka, a Ukrainian town occupied by Russians since 2014, was interrogated multiple times, with each session lasting at least two hours, he told the Kyiv Independent.</p><p>As he is a Ukrainian citizen, Versdysh is facing charges of high treason for fighting alongside Russia. If found guilty, he could be sentenced to up to 15 years. </p><p>Like many POWs here, he wants to be swapped. </p><p>""I’m aware of the punishment (for the high treason). I would like to be exchanged and return home,"" Versdysh told the Kyiv Independent while in the camps’ sickbay waiting for the online court hearings. </p><figure class=""kg-card kg-bookmark-card""><a class=""kg-bookmark-container"" href=""https://kyivindependent.com/inside-a-russian-militant-army-the-story-of-a-ukrainian-forced-to-fight-against-his-homeland/""><div class=""kg-bookmark-content""><div class=""kg-bookmark-title"">Escaping Russian army: The story of one Ukrainian forced to fight against his homeland</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-description"">Editor’s Note: The name of the person interviewed by the Kyiv Independent for this story has been changed to protect his identity as he has shared sensitive information that could place him and his family in danger. “If Russia orders us to invade the entire galaxy, we will,” the</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-metadata""><img class=""kg-bookmark-icon"" src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/size/w256h256/format/png/2023/03/K-new.svg"" alt=""""><span class=""kg-bookmark-author"">The Kyiv Independent</span><span class=""kg-bookmark-publisher"">Alexander Khrebet</span></div></div><div class=""kg-bookmark-thumbnail""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1239116213-1660056573zl72q.jpg"" alt=""""></div></a></figure>

      <p><strong>Hroza, Kharkiv Oblast - </strong>Serhii Pletinka rushed to the scene just after a Russian Iskander-M missile struck a packed cafe in the village of <a href=""https://kyivindependent.com/governor-russian-attack-on-kharkiv-oblast-village-kills-49-including-6-year-old-child/"">Hroza in Kharkiv Oblast</a>. </p><p>A soldier on vacation who lives just across the street from the cafe was the first to witness the fire, screams, and bodies.</p><p>“I was thrown by the blast wave, but I immediately ran (to the scene of the attack). A woman was screaming. She had broken legs and was pinned down by a refrigerator. She didn't understand what was happening,” Serhii told the Kyiv Independent. </p><p>A Russian missile struck the cafe on Oct. 5, where around 60 people had come for the funeral reception of the fallen soldier after his reburial in a cemetery nearby. The strike killed at least 52 people, including a child, and injured six others in what is the <a href=""https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-kills-51-people-in-single-deadliest-attack-against-civilians-this-year/"">deadliest attack</a> against civilians in Ukraine in 2023. </p><p>This was the first strike on the village during the full-scale invasion. Villagers and the law enforcement agency investigating the Russian attack believe that someone among the locals may have informed Russian forces about the funeral, which was supposed to involve military personnel. </p><p>The village of Hroza had a pre-war population of around 300 residents. Since many have fled since the start of the full-scale invasion, the attack killed roughly half of the residents who have stayed. </p><p>“We rescued only five people. Police and emergency services rescued others. The rest were dead,” Pletinka, a soldier who spent two months in a Russian torture chamber while Hroza was occupied, said.</p><figure class=""kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/_MG_9028.JPG"" class=""kg-image"" alt loading=""lazy""><figcaption>Emergency workers clear the rubble at the site of a cafe that was entirely destroyed by a Russian missile in the village of Hroza, Kharkiv Oblast, on Oct. 5.

This is the genocide of Ukrainians,” he told the Kyiv Independent, interrupting himself to say the name of his friend who was killed in the attack, Anzhela.</p><p>Shudravyi, like other villagers, believes someone among locals leaked information to the Russian forces about the burial of the fallen soldier, as top commanders of the Aidar Battalion could possibly have been at the funeral. </p><p>Kharkiv Oblast Prosecutor’s Office supports this version as well. Dmytro Chubenko, a spokesperson for the prosecutor’s office, said the investigators are verifying the information. </p><p>“Everyone wants to find logic to the attack.

      <p>Svitlana Oslavska and Anna Ilchenko embarked on a mission in 2020 to document Ukraine’s villages before they were lost to time and war.<br><br>Traversing across Ukraine’s vast landscape, the sisters started speaking to people from villages about topics as diverse as the best construction method of a house to their contemplations on life and death.<br><br>They select brief yet emotionally charged excerpts from their recorded conversations with locals to share on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/oldkhataproject/"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/old_khata_project/?fbclid=IwAR3gH5JM4Zl4ImTPvxfEYsty5eCbZ7GRfdg6cg15AjwcG6iRxrl53ZjCx7I"">Instagram</a> under the title Old khata project. The word “khata” roughly means “cottage” in English, an apt description of the unique old architectural style of homes found in Ukrainian villages.</p><p>Ukraine’s rural population is shrinking yearly, with many people moving to larger cities or abroad for better prospects. Documenting these villages and the people who still call them home has been a way of preserving an important – yet slowly vanishing – part of Ukraine’s cultural legacy.<br><br>With Russia’s all-out war against Ukraine impacting many villages, the Old khata project also became a testimony to the Ukrainian people’s resilience. <br><br>The journalist-photographer duo has visited nearly 100 villages across Ukraine over the past three years, including villages in Luhansk Oblast that have since fallen under Russian occupation and now-destroyed villages in Kherson Oblast.<br><br>“This is what cannot be restored, and it's crucial that we were able to document it. Even without the war, sooner or later, time would have destroyed these houses,” Ilchenko told the Kyiv Independent.<br><br>“To some extent, each photograph is a monument and, simultaneously, a trace of the past.”</p><figure class=""kg-card kg-bookmark-card""><a class=""kg-bookmark-container"" href=""https://kyivindependent.com/how-russia-steals-and-rewrites-ukrainian-history-to-justify-its-claims-in-ukraine/""><div class=""kg-bookmark-content""><div class=""kg-bookmark-title"">How Russia steals and rewrites Ukrainian history to justify its claims in Ukraine</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-description"">Appropriating and rewriting foreign history has been a key aspect of Russia’s imperialist narratives.

(Courtesy: Old khata project)</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the fact that an increasing number of Ukrainians are relocating to urban centers, village life continues to exert an appeal in Ukrainian culture. <br><br>Ukraine is fundamentally an agrarian society and day-to-day village life is tied to farming, livestock, and being connected with nature. Strong bonds have been formed in these small communities, making it easier to preserve and pass down traditions related to food, language, folk songs, religion, and more.<br><br>Many Ukrainians return to their family’s native villages during important holidays like Easter or for a short vacation to reconnect with their roots and unwind in nature.<br><br>In every Ukrainian novel where village life is prominently featured, nature holds a certain magnetism. For example, in Olha Kobylianska’s novella “Earth” (1901) the heroine is introduced as loving “nature above all.”<br><br>“She used to wander in the mountains… alone. She knew the mountainous outskirts as well as her own room, and she would head for one of the best and wildest nooks of the forest during her summer walkings.” (Translation by Lesya Budna)</p><p>Traveling across Ukraine has ultimately reinforced the sisters’ belief that the division of Ukraine between East and West is “an artificial construct of political operatives,” as Oslavska put it.  <br><br>According to Oslavska, Ukrainian life isn't so much divided along a regional axis as it is along the axis of Kyiv or any other major city or district center and village life. Each region has its characteristics that shape locals’ worldviews. However, based on their travels, the sisters caution against making any sweeping generalizations about Ukrainians.<br><br>“When we visit different corners of the country and get to know people, we avoid making such generalizations, whether positive or negative. We came to understand that people, at their core, are similar, but their place of residence and historical circumstances influence them, and that's perfectly normal,” she said.  </p><figure class=""kg-card kg-bookmark-card""><a class=""kg-bookmark-container"" href=""https://kyivindependent.com/invasion-rooted-in-history-a-review-of-serhii-plokhys-the-russo-ukrainian-war/""><div class=""kg-bookmark-content""><div class=""kg-bookmark-title"">Invasion rooted in history: A review of Serhii Plokhy’s ‘The Russo-Ukrainian War’</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-description"">For many people worldwide, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine appeared unprecedented and unthinkable.

They launched a crowdfunding campaign in the summer of 2021 to expand the Old Khata Project nationwide.<br><br>The sisters explained that the most interesting part has been traveling to regions they knew the least about and had hardly or never been to, including parts of Sumy, Kherson, and Mykolaiv oblasts.<br><br>“It was fascinating to listen to the local dialects and meet such wonderful people, no matter where we went. Each region has its unique architectural features in building and decorating houses,” Oslavska said.</p><p>According to Ilchenko, physically preserving many of these houses is a “utopian (concept), much like trying to preserve a certain period in time.”<br><br>That’s why photographing them opens up the possibility to “rediscover the forgotten, draw inspiration from them, and create new narratives and forms of existence for Ukrainian houses.”<br><br>During their travels, the sisters have discovered not only local traditions but moving and unique stories.<br><br>For example, they met an elderly man from a village in the Carpathians who would <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CLlkWrhn-I5/?img_index=2"">nail a small wooden cross</a> to his house on each anniversary of his wife’s passing.<br><br>“It's not typical, and it's not practiced anywhere else, but he established his own tradition of memory,” Ilchenko said.<br><br>The sisters take the basic approach of documentarians to their work, spending several days in a particular village, talking to local people, walking the streets, and taking photos.<br><br>“We talked to people about their homes, how they were built, and recorded these conversations on a recorder, occasionally on video,” Oslavska said. <br><br>However, the sisters quickly realized they didn’t want to craft a “typical” reportage describing these people and their houses in the third person – they wanted the people and houses to speak for themselves. <br><br>“Through these houses, we can see how people lived during Soviet times, what (architectural and design influences) came to us from other epochs and empires, and what independent Ukraine has contributed to them. This incredible palimpsest tells us, ultimately, who we are,” Ilchenko said.<br><br>“While houses don't speak, they are sometimes no less interesting than their owners.”</p><figure class=""kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-full""><div class=""swiper""><div class=""swiper-pagination""></div><div class=""swiper-button-prev""></div><div class=""swiper-button-next""></div><div class=""swiper-wrapper""><div class=""swiper-slide""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/DSC00354-1.JPG"" width=""4976"" height=""3317"" loading=""lazy"" alt><figcaption>Old Khata Book (Photo: Old khata project)</figcaption></div><div class=""swiper-slide""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/DSC00355-2.JPG"" width=""5263"" height=""3509"" loading=""lazy"" alt><figcaption>Old Khata Book (Photo: Old Khata Project)</figcaption></div></div></div></figure><p>In the book, a man named Mykhailo from the village of Kosmach in western Ukraine’s Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast described building a house as once being “sacred work” compared to today. He emphasized the importance of selecting the right plot of land, taking into account factors such as where the cows would graze.<br><br>A woman named Vira from the village of Volosivka in Zhytomyr Oblast shared that a house shouldn't stand alone. She emphasized the importance of having nearby trees, which not only provide shade but sometimes bear fruit as well.<br><br>These examples highlight the practical aspects of building a house in the village and the careful consideration that went into their design.<br><br>The choice of building materials like wood, clay, and straw depended on the local climate and people's budgets. Some features, such as a chimney, could be seen as a luxury. Houses also needed regular maintenance. Symbols like crosses, the sun, moon, or animals could be found carved on house exteriors, depending on the region. <br><br>Despite the distinctiveness of regional architectural styles, Oslavska and Ilchenko found some commonalities no matter where in Ukraine they traveled – for example, the use of the color blue. Even cemeteries feature the color blue, the sisters said.<br><br>When village residents were asked why they’d chosen the color for their homes, they simply replied that it was beautiful or it had always been that way.<br><br>The sisters plan to continue the Old khata project and have ideas for new forms of the project beyond social media.

      <p>Known for its innovative e-governing system and booming IT industry, Estonia made a supposedly groundbreaking move in 2017. By launching a licensing system for cryptocurrency companies, the Baltic country wanted to become the first in the European Union to regulate crypto business.</p><p>Instead, Estonia became a haven for international crypto criminals attracted by the opportunity to receive the prestigious “licensed in the EU” title for their sham firms. With more credibility, they have laundered or defrauded victims for over 1 billion euros, a new journalist investigation has found.</p><p>An international consortium of journalists analyzed close to 300 Estonian-registered crypto companies and discovered dozens of crimes: massive-scale fraud, money laundering, sanctions evasion, and illicit financing of Russian paramilitary organizations such as Wagner Group.</p><p>Reporters also found links between an Estonia-registered crypto company and Sberbank, Russia’s largest, majority state-owned bank.</p><p>The media outlets involved in the project include Delfi (Estonia), Siena.lt (Lithuania), Frontstory.pl (Poland), Paper Trail Media, Der Spiegel and ZDF (Germany), and Der Standard (Austria), among others. </p><p>The Kyiv Independent contributed research to this story.

The company is registered under different, primarily Russian names across jurisdictions. </p><p>Like Payeer, another international crypto-firm, MoneySwap OÜ, operating the virtual assets platform Mercuryo, set up a new business in Lithuania. In 2022, the company entered the local market as MoneyAmber UAB.</p><p>The shares of both the Estonian and Lithuanian business entities of Mercuryo are managed through the Cypriot company MRCR Holdings. Among its shareholders is Akshin Dzhangirov, who has close ties to Sberbank. His brother Dzhangir Dzhangirov is the Chief Risk Officer at Sberbank, while Akshin himself reportedly received about 285,600 euros in income from Sberbank in 2021.</p><p>A representative of Mercuryo told journalists that the platform has no business relations with Sberbank and has an unequivocal “stance against the ongoing war in Ukraine.”</p>

The occupation authorities reportedly appointed Russians to key security service and justice posts, while other positions were held primarily by Ukrainians.</p><p>For instance, NGL Media found that Ukrainian collaborators headed 87% of local police stations and 80% of prisons and detention centers.</p><p>NGL Media created a database of the identified occupation officials and mapped their registered addresses in occupation territories.</p><p>Under Ukrainian legislation, those collaborating with occupation authorities by taking a leadership position in the courts or law enforcement agencies could <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/en/2341-14"">face</a> 12-15 years in prison or even a life sentence under exceptional circumstances.</p><p><em>Read the full investigation in Ukrainian</em><a href=""https://ngl.media/2023/09/28/nashi-zradniki/""><em> <strong>here</strong></em></a>.</p><h3 id=""how-russian-forces-killed-civilians-on-a-highway-outside-kyiv-burned-evidence-early-in-invasion"">How Russian forces killed civilians on a highway outside Kyiv, burned evidence early in invasion</h3><p>In the early days of the full-scale invasion, Russian soldiers killed at least 14 and wounded seven civilians along a short stretch of the E60 highway seven kilometers west of Kyiv, according to an investigation by Texty, a Ukrainian media outlet.</p><p>Texty’s story is based on interviews with local police, prosecutors, witnesses, and survivors of the attack, as well as on video footage. The investigation shows that Russian forces targeted civilian vehicles that were driving along the highway and killed people traveling on foot in the area.</p><p>According to the journalist investigation, Russian forces killed 27 people along this highway, including 14 civilians and eight people who have not been identified.</p><p>In an attempt to hide their war crimes, Russian forces burned the cars of the victims and their bodies, according to video footage and statements by local authorities.</p><p>Russian forces took up positions along the highway on March 3, 2022, drone footage shows. On that day, they reportedly killed a civilian man who was walking in the area. They used to regularly kill civilians there until the area was liberated in early April, according to the journalist investigation.</p><p>Local police and prosecutors told Texty that the 2nd battalion of the 5th tank brigade, a unit within the 36th Combined Arms Army, held the position. The 36th army participated in the siege of Kyiv, and authorities previously<a href=""https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-accuses-russian-commander-of-giving-order-to-shoot-at-civilians-in-bucha/""> charged</a> soldiers from the army for participating in the Bucha massacre.</p><p>According to Russian media, the commander of the 2nd battalion was later killed in action.

Here's what they asked, and how we answered. </em><a href=""https://kyivindependent.com/membership""><em>Join our community</em></a><em> to ask a question in the next round.</em></p><h3 id=""question-what-factors-will-swing-the-war-decisively-in-ukraines-favor"">Question: What factors will swing the war decisively in Ukraine's favor?</h3><p><strong>Answer: </strong>One very simple conclusion that can be made from the last year of the war is that large-scale offensive operations have gotten a lot harder to do successfully for both sides than a year ago, and they are likely to only get harder.</p><p>Beyond this counteroffensive, both sides will look to take the upper hand in a war of attrition, to degrade the enemy more than they themselves are degraded so that they can attack again with more relative strength at some point. For this, the most important factors are manpower, drones, the capacity for longer-range strikes on logistics, and shells, shells, and more shells.</p><p>There don't look to be any other shortcuts anymore, but if Ukraine can truly gain free reign over the airspace in Crimea, the political and military consequences of that for Russia might just be the asymmetrical factor that can change the overall battlefield. – <em>Francis Farrell, reporter</em></p><figure class=""kg-card kg-bookmark-card""><a class=""kg-bookmark-container"" href=""https://kyivindependent.com/attrition-shortages-tactical-inconsistency-russian-blunders-on-southern-front/""><div class=""kg-bookmark-content""><div class=""kg-bookmark-title"">Russia’s southern mistake — Surovikin lines, Gerasimov tactics</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-description"">The Zaporizhzhia front has been abuzz with news of Ukrainians breaking through Russia’s first defensive line and chiseling away at a breach in the second. “They’re widening that breach at this stage to enable the flow of armored vehicles and logistics so they can exploit it,” Michael Kofman,</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-metadata""><img class=""kg-bookmark-icon"" src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/size/w256h256/format/png/2023/03/K-new.svg"" alt=""""><span class=""kg-bookmark-author"">The Kyiv Independent</span><span class=""kg-bookmark-publisher"">Igor Kossov</span></div></div><div class=""kg-bookmark-thumbnail""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1583201742.jpg"" alt=""""></div></a></figure><h3 id=""question-now-that-the-counteroffensive-broke-through-the-russian-front-lines-how-is-ukraine-dealing-with-the-minefields"">Question: Now that the counteroffensive broke through the Russian front lines, how is Ukraine dealing with the minefields?</h3><p><strong>Answer: </strong>Minefields are still a very dicey business. You may have seen reports, including my own, repeat some Ukrainian commanders' words that they expect the mines to be less psychotically dense past the second line and so on because, in front of the first, there were straight up three to five of them per square meter.</p><p>And, it's not even ground, it's all wedged under obnoxiously dense ground foliage, which adds a whole other layer, while the Russian positions ahead are shooting you.</p><p>However, I've been admonished by a colonel in the know that the landmine density isn't going to fall off that hard. Russia has what seems like an inexhaustible supply of them, and they don't take very long to set up. So they're going to be a problem this whole offensive and beyond.</p><p>Now, as for how Ukraine is dealing with them.</p><p>The country is developing and using high tech tools like demining robots that can detect stuff, or at least can push or drag a plough-like thing that gets the mines, to clear a ground path through them.</p><p>These kinds of contraptions are sometimes affixed to tanks or other vehicles, but it's a great way to lose a tank to mines or someone just blasting it from up ahead. Ukraine also has and is making more drones with thermographic sights that can detect unexploded stuff in liberated areas. – <em>Igor Kossov, reporter</em></p><figure class=""kg-card kg-bookmark-card""><a class=""kg-bookmark-container"" href=""https://kyivindependent.com/overcoming-setbacks-nato-trained-brigade-breaches-surovikin-line-in-zaporizhzhia-oblast/""><div class=""kg-bookmark-content""><div class=""kg-bookmark-title"">Overcoming setbacks, NATO-trained brigade breaches Surovikin line in Zaporizhzhia Oblast</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-description"">Editor’s note: The soldiers featured in this article are identified by first name and callsign only for security reasons.

It is mostly sourced from Europe.</p><p>However, these vehicles and more advanced stuff like robots are all pretty scarce, and according to my contact, a lot of front-line demining is also done by hand, with sensitive metal detectors. Ukraine doesn't get a lot of mine-clearing stuff as part of its military aid packages, as far as I'm told, and it could use as much of this stuff as possible.</p><p>There are many different variations on the type of vehicle I linked above, and Ukraine can use all of them, as well as any support that helps accelerate and scale up domestic ground drone production. – <em>Igor Kossov, reporter</em></p><figure class=""kg-card kg-bookmark-card""><a class=""kg-bookmark-container"" href=""https://kyivindependent.com/russias-landmines-are-highly-advanced-and-increasingly-difficult-to-clear/""><div class=""kg-bookmark-content""><div class=""kg-bookmark-title"">Russia is covering Ukraine with landmines.

How it may affect Ukraine's ability to take back occupied territories?</h3><p><strong>Answer: </strong>It won't substantially affect Ukraine's ability on the front lines. Ukraine's Defense Minister is currently responsible for the procurement of weapons via formats like the one named after Ramstein and organizational stuff, like making sure soldiers have what to eat and what to wear.</p><p>Under Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov, a number of corruption scandals damaged the ministry's reputation. However, overall, soldiers had food to eat and weapons to shoot from.</p><p>The big picture is overseen by President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p><p>There is room for improvement, but even if the ministry suddenly eradicates corruption and mismanagement, it won't have a decisive effect on the battlefield since Ukraine's lack of manpower, western jets, and long-range missiles isn't the ministry's fault, nor it can hope to fix these issues. <em>– Oleksiy Sorokin, deputy chief editor</em></p><figure class=""kg-card kg-bookmark-card""><a class=""kg-bookmark-container"" href=""https://kyivindependent.com/who-is-rustem-umerov-ukraines-soon-to-be-defense-minister/""><div class=""kg-bookmark-content""><div class=""kg-bookmark-title"">Who is Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s soon-to-be defense minister?</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-description"">When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Sept. 3 that Rustem Umerov was Ukraine’s soon-to-be defense minister, he said the former MP “needs no introduction.” Days before, Umerov had been rumored to be the main candidate to replace Oleksiy Reznikov, who had held the post since Novemb…</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-metadata""><img class=""kg-bookmark-icon"" src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/size/w256h256/format/png/2023/03/K-new.svg"" alt=""""><span class=""kg-bookmark-author"">The Kyiv Independent</span><span class=""kg-bookmark-publisher"">Elsa Court</span></div></div><div class=""kg-bookmark-thumbnail""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/Fwg-DGnWIAkfPD2.jpg"" alt=""""></div></a></figure><h3 id=""question-zelensky-has-promised-elections-if-the-west-furnishes-the-funding-for-them-%E2%80%93-assuming-such-funding-is-given-does-this-mean-that-other-parties-would-be-free-in-their-political-campaigns-to-criticize-the-handling-of-the-war-by-zelensky-and-his-party"">Question: Zelensky has promised elections if the West furnishes the funding for them – assuming such funding is given, does this mean that other parties would be free in their political campaigns to criticize the handling of the war by Zelensky and his party? </h3><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Holding elections during an ongoing active war is absurd and less democratic than postponing them until everyone can vote and everyone can compete.</p><p>Political parties won't have funds to launch proper election campaigns while spending the money on political ads won't be supported by society.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky's words about the willingness to hold elections if the West pays for it isn't a serious claim.</p><p>Millions won't be able to vote, candidates won't have the freedom to compete, and those who would have a chance to be elected are currently busy fighting Russian troops at the front. <em>– Oleksiy Sorokin, deputy chief editor</em></p><figure class=""kg-card kg-bookmark-card""><a class=""kg-bookmark-container"" href=""https://kyivindependent.com/holding-elections-during-full-scale-war-doesnt-make-sense-experts-say/""><div class=""kg-bookmark-content""><div class=""kg-bookmark-title"">Why Ukraine likely won’t hold elections next year</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-description"">When Russian President Vladimir Putin holds a fake vote to extend his mandate in March 2024, Ukraine will not be allowed to hold an election due to the martial law imposed amid Russia’s aggression.

Will there be provision for those who remain to vote in the presidential elections next year?</h3><p><strong>Answer: </strong>Ukrainian men from 18 to 60 years of age aren't allowed to leave the country during martial law. What will happen after the war is over is hard to imagine, but I would assume that freedom of travel will be restored, and those who want to leave will have this ability.</p><p>Currently, it is unknown how many people in the long-occupied areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea actually support Russia and wouldn't be able to live without the occupying state. <strong> </strong></p><p>I'm confident Ukraine won't evict those people from their homes en masse<em>– Oleksiy Sorokin, deputy chief editor</em></p><h3 id=""question-what-is-the-best-estimate-of-deaths-on-either-side-%E2%80%93-tallying-civilian-and-military-casualties-separately"">Question: What is the best estimate of deaths on either side – tallying civilian and military casualties separately?</h3><p><strong>Answer:</strong> I think that although a lot of us were skeptical about the official Russian casualty figures published daily by Ukraine's General Staff, 19 months of war have shown them to be pretty much in line with official U.S. estimates, and to match the relative intensity of periods of fighting as the war goes on.</p><p>The latest neutral(ish) information we have from Washington about casualties from both sides was from <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/18/us/politics/ukraine-russia-war-casualties.html"">this</a> report from the New York Times in August, which puts Russian combat deaths at about 120,000 and Ukrainian at about 70,000 – obviously with even more wounded on both sides.</p><p>I'm inclined to say these figures are probably in the ballpark. As for civilians – the big question is Mariupol. The nature of the fight there with a huge city surrounded like that has probably produced a number of civilian deaths that dwarfs everything else, but it might be a long time before we get solid numbers on that. – <em>Francis Farrell, reporter</em></p><h3 id=""question-why-do-i-see-so-many-young-conscription-age-men-not-in-uniform-in-video-scenes-of-ukrainian-cities"">Question: Why do I see so many young, conscription-age men not in uniform in video scenes of Ukrainian cities?</h3><p><strong>Answer: </strong>Conscription-aged men are not obliged to go to the front unless they received a draft, and at least at the beginning of the war, there were enough volunteers (civilians who rose up to defend their country) to more or less hold the front line – with great difficulty.</p><p>There are also not enough weapons, uniforms, and basic provisions for the country to conscript everyone. Many men who aren't fighting are working in their civilian professions, thus helping to keep the country afloat amid the ongoing war.</p><p>This scenery, however, can be uncomfortable for Ukrainian soldiers who are on the front line after losing so many of their comrades and constantly fighting with a lack of manpower – with many worrying what could happen if the human resource ends before that of the Russians.</p><p>They say that many of the mobilized soldiers are over 40, and it's usually very tough for them to carry weapons/bulletproof vests/water (which could all add up to 40 kilograms) and walk a few kilometers (sometimes as long as six) to the zero line to defend or assault a position.</p><p>This normalcy seen in Kyiv and other cities far from the front line is part of a societal gap that is expected to widen further as the war continues to rage on and Ukrainian soldiers – many of whom are already extremely exhausted – keep doing everything to fight day by day.</p><p>While there are missile and drone attacks targeting cities far from the front line, Ukrainian soldiers mostly say they are frustrated that some members of the society are forgetting the war and the real cost of defending the territory. <em>– Asami Terajima, reporter</em></p><h3 id=""question-im-fascinated-by-these-cardboard-drones-can-they-fly-through-rain-how-are-they-powered-how-efficient-are-they-compared-to-conventional-artillery"">Question: I'm fascinated by these cardboard drones.

While you could argue whether FPV drones (much cheaper and with a much shorter range) could start to replace normal artillery shells on the battlefield, these longer-range, fixed-wing drones fit a different niche that's not really equivalent to any traditional munition. <em>– Francis Farrell, reporter</em></p><figure class=""kg-card kg-bookmark-card""><a class=""kg-bookmark-container"" href=""https://kyivindependent.com/head-first-into-the-future-inside-the-race-to-win-the-drone-war-in-ukraine/""><div class=""kg-bookmark-content""><div class=""kg-bookmark-title"">Deadly drone arms race intensifies as Ukraine, Russia embrace the future of war</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-description"">At this stage of a war that could last years more, both Ukraine and Russia are getting serious with their drone game: ramping up production while always looking to come up with new innovations.</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-metadata""><img class=""kg-bookmark-icon"" src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/size/w256h256/format/png/2023/03/K-new.svg"" alt=""""><span class=""kg-bookmark-author"">The Kyiv Independent</span><span class=""kg-bookmark-publisher"">Francis Farrell</span></div></div><div class=""kg-bookmark-thumbnail""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/DSCF9077-2.jpg"" alt=""""></div></a></figure><h3 id=""question-which-side-is-at-greater-long-term-risk-of-running-out-of-%E2%80%93-soldiers-weapons-ability-to-pay-for-the-war-andor-internal-support-or-at-least-willingness-to-go-along-with-the-war"">Question: Which side is at greater long-term risk of running out of – soldiers, weapons, ability to pay for the war and/or internal support or at least willingness to go along with the war?</h3><p><strong>Answer: </strong>It's a numbers game, and it depends a lot on outside factors.</p><p>Russia has a larger population to draw people from, and honestly, they can probably keep dragging people off to war without major issues. Yes, some people will run, but overall the country has shown time and time again that you can never expect anything impactful to come from the bottom up.</p><p>As for weapons and finances, the most important factor for Ukraine is, of course, outside support, and there, I think the 2024 U.S. presidential elections will decide a lot.</p><p>For Russia, their huge military industry is stepping up production, but not enough to make up for losses and expenditures.

      <p>When Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, the world struggled to understand how it was possible that war had once again returned to Europe in the 21st century.</p><p>Eighteen months later, the world wants to know how it will all end. </p><p>In both cases, historians are needed. And many have looked to renowned Yale historian Timothy Snyder — author of several books on European and Ukrainian history. </p><p>His 2018 book ""The Road to Unfreedom: Russia, Europe, America"" offers its readers a deeper understanding of why Russia initially annexed Crimea and invaded eastern Ukraine back in 2014. The book undoubtedly helps to make sense of the current moment in Ukraine. </p><p>Last fall, Snyder published recordings of his course on Ukrainian history, “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh9mgdi4rNewfxO7LhBoz_1Mx1MaO6sw_"">The Making of Modern Ukraine</a>,” online. The lectures have been watched and listened to by millions. </p><p>The Kyiv Independent took a walk with Snyder through Ukraine’s historic Golden Gate neighborhood following the Yalta European Strategy (YES) Conference that took place in Kyiv on Sept. 8-9. </p><p>We discussed how and where Ukrainian and world history intersect, Ukraine’s contentious historical figures, and why Crimea has to be a part of Ukraine if the world wants peace in the region. </p><p><em>This interview has been edited for clarity. </em></p><p><strong>The Kyiv Independent: During your talk with First Lady Olena Zelenska at the YES Conference, you said that one of the reasons your students really like Ukrainian history is not necessarily because it’s Ukraine but because they see world history in Ukrainian history. What did you mean by that, and why do you think Ukrainian history speaks to your students in the United States?</strong></p><p><strong>Timothy Snyder</strong>: When any country tries to sell its history abroad, it generally tries to create a simpler version of what its people already think.</p><p>(People) concentrate on very basic things that they think foreigners can understand. That never works. Partly because it isn’t interesting and also because generally what you think about your own country isn’t true so it doesn't travel very well.</p><p>Ukraine has a tremendous advantage in that its history really is connected to almost everything else. It touches all these narratives that people think they know. Nobody thinks of Ukraine and ancient Greece, but, in fact, the whole of Athenian civilization was in a symbiosis with what's now southern Ukraine. The food that Russia is now burning and destroying, those fields fed Pericles, Socrates, and Plato. </p><figure class=""kg-card kg-bookmark-card""><a class=""kg-bookmark-container"" href=""https://kyivindependent.com/russias-centuries-long-quest-to-conquer-ukraine/""><div class=""kg-bookmark-content""><div class=""kg-bookmark-title"">Russia’s centuries-long quest to conquer Ukraine</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-description"">Editor’s Note: This is episode 2 of “Ukraine’s True History,” a video and story series by the Kyiv Independent.

These big European themes (are present in Ukrainian history), except it's more interesting and more complicated because there are more religions. </p><p>So, basically, whatever starting point people have, if they have any starting point at all, Ukraine adds something to it and it makes the whole story make more sense. </p><p>But I mean something else by it too, which is that everybody's obsessed now with this North-South, colonial-non-colonial thing. Ukraine, although it's hard to describe exactly how, is in the middle of that. It’s neither Northern nor Southern, it's neither colonial nor non-colonial. It’s a country from which you can understand both. (From which) you can understand that Ukraine has a history of statehood, but it also has a history of being colonized. It has a history of being the center of the slave trade in the world and it also has a history of independence. So it has a connection to what are thought of as these big blocs, the (global) North and South.</p><p><strong>The Kyiv Independent: How in your view does the Russian propaganda narrative that Ukraine is full of Nazis or being run by a Nazi government find a receptive audience in the West? </strong></p><p>There is a history of Ukrainian fascism and a history of Ukrainian collaboration that should be studied. Nobody should skip it or overlook it. But when you're in a moment like this where many things are possible, it's also important to remember that radical things are possible and to watch out for them.</p><p>That said, the facts of Ukrainian collaboration and fascism basically have zero connection to the propaganda reality. People in the West who talk about “Ukrainian Nazis” don't know anything about Ukrainian history. So the problem is not that they have this view of Ukraine, (it’s that) they don't know anything about Ukrainian history. They're working from a Soviet narrative of convenience which was built up after World War II, where collaboration was allocated nationally to the convenience of Moscow. </p><p>If Russia needed to discipline the Ukrainian (Soviet) Republic, it would say the Ukrainian (Soviet) Republic was full of collaboration. That narrative of discipline, that narrative of using collaboration was then used after 1991 by Russia as well to say that “we were the ones who won World War II and those guys were the ones who were maybe on the wrong side.”</p><p>My view now is that it is important for Ukrainians not to get caught up in that. Ukrainians are stuck on (Stepan) Bandera because Russia wants them to be. You don't want to be talking about the parts of your history that Russia wants you to talk about. </p><p><strong>The Kyiv Independent: Every country needs its national heroes, though, right? How does Ukraine deal with these contentious parts of its history and find new national heroes? </strong></p><p>I'm not a big fan of the idea of heroes. I understand that we should recognize soldiers and volunteers and other people for their courage, but the idea of a hero means that someone is beyond the human. And nobody's beyond the human. </p><p>As soon as you make someone your hero, you expect them to be perfect and you can't revise your view of them anymore at all and someone else will try to make them into a villain. </p><p>So I tend to think that looking at history, the better word would be examples. You're always going to find people who are in complicated situations and did something extraordinary as opposed to a hero who was somehow above the normal rules, right?</p><figure class=""kg-card kg-bookmark-card""><a class=""kg-bookmark-container"" href=""https://kyivindependent.com/witness-to-war-a-review-of-serhiy-zhadans-sky-above-kharkiv/""><div class=""kg-bookmark-content""><div class=""kg-bookmark-title"">Witness to war: A review of Serhiy Zhadan’s ‘Sky Above Kharkiv’</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-description"">Less than a month into the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian shelling destroyed a popular bookstore on Kharkiv’s main street.

It’s much easier for Ukrainians in 2023 to understand this war, than it is for them to understand the war of 1939 to 1945 or 1914 to 1918. And this war is full of examples of people who took risks and did good things. </p><p>I tend to think that in 50 years when Ukrainians are looking back, they'll be looking back at this war and I think that's rather a good thing. </p><p>But as far as looking for these examples, the trick is not to look where your enemy tells you to look. If your enemy is telling you to look somewhere, maybe instead try to think creatively about, (for example), the people in 1918 who were actually trying to found the Ukrainian state, or the people under the Soviet Union who took risks, (or about) Andrei Sheptytsky who saved more than 100 Jews. </p><p>There are lots of places to look. You want to be creative about where you're looking and not let other people tell you where you should be looking.</p><p><strong>The Kyiv Independent: Is it possible for Ukraine to make peace with countries like Poland or other countries by elevating these controversial figures or having streets named after them?</strong></p><p>What Ukrainian streets are named is up to the Ukrainians. I won’t tell Ukrainians what to do, but I can give you an assessment which is that I think that when Ukrainians name things after Bandera and (Roman) Shukhevych, they think it's just us and the Russians in the world and they're not thinking about the Jews and they're not thinking about the Poles. And Bandera, and especially Shukhevych, have a lot to do with Jewish and Polish history.</p><p>So I think that when Ukrainians are renaming streets, they should be thinking about Ukraine and the global (aspect) at the same time. </p><p>What Ukrainians shouldn't be doing is thinking this is going to make the Russians upset because as soon as you're doing something to make the Russians upset you're just falling into their trap because they've already thought ahead about it. They're happy every time a street in Ukraine is named after Bandera.</p><p>Russia doesn't really care about the legacy of Bandera. There is nobody in Moscow who actually cares about Bandera, they just see Bandera as a trap for Ukrainians. So when you name a street after Bandera, there are very few Russians who are upset by it and there are many Russians who are happy. </p><figure class=""kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/SOL07082.jpg"" class=""kg-image"" alt loading=""lazy"" width=""3000"" height=""2000""><figcaption>Historian Timothy Snyder and Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska at the Yalta European Strategy Conference in Kyiv on Sept. 9, 2023 in Kyiv.

They said the NATO officers don't understand the reality on the ground.</p><p>""A NATO infantryman knows he's supported and can advance with the confidence that there's a high likelihood that he won't be killed or maimed,"" Ihor said.</p><p>The NATO way of war calls for massive preparatory airstrikes and artillery barrages and demining before the infantry is sent in, he added.</p><p>It usually doesn't work that way in Ukraine.</p><p>Between the country's tiny, old air force, ancient T-64s, and a continuing shortage of artillery shells and infantry vehicles, it often falls to infantry to hold the line against Russian probing attacks and occasional assaults, supported by overwhelming artillery and huge numbers of drones.</p><p>Troops said they sometimes struggle to apply NATO small unit tactics because there often isn't enough cover to do so.</p><p>Zgurets said that the instructors in Germany put a lot of emphasis on teaching urban combat. But the skills of how to smoke an enemy out from a trench, how to build an assault group, and coordinate it with artillery and drone support were lacking.</p><p>The style of battle in the Ukrainian countryside, blending World War I trench combat and 21st-century tech and tactics, are only seen in Ukraine — they are outside NATO's wheelhouse.</p><p>Furthermore, the translators that are used often lack a military background and fail to convey accurate commands or responses between instructors and trainees, Zgurets added.</p><p>He said that it would be helpful for some of these instructors to visit Ukraine.</p><p>""European countries can correct their training,"" Zgurets said. ""There has been a mutual understanding of experiences and concerns, and this is the moment when they can be cleared away.""<br><br>Retired U.S. Major General Gordon Davis told the Kyiv Independent that training by NATO allies has been ""indispensable. While specific tactics and procedures promoted by allied trainers may not have achieved the results that Ukrainian leadership and forces expected, the reason for this shortfall is certainly multi-dimensional.""   <br><br>He added that the training abroad is still better than Ukraine can offer and while realism could be improved, it'd take a huge investment for training programs to be able to replicate Russian tactics.</p><p>""Therefore, it is all the more important for Ukraine to invest in the quality of Western provided or supported training by contributing the missing pieces of current combat intelligence and lessons learned from personal Ukrainian sacrifice and success.""</p><figure class=""kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-01-at-12.29.54b.jpg"" class=""kg-image"" alt loading=""lazy"" width=""1296"" height=""864""><figcaption>Soldiers with the 32nd Mechanized Brigade on the move in May, two months before being going to the frontline.

""They don't want to think about it.""</p><p>Volodymyr himself refused to speak, but once Ihor began explaining the situation, he eventually joined the conversation in fragments, adding this or that observation. By the end, Volodymyr can barely contain his bleak descriptions of the vagaries of combat.</p><p>""A heroic feat — to jump out from that basement and shoot aimlessly in their general direction, then end up without an arm or a leg, or just dead?"" Volodymyr said. ""What's the point?""</p><p>To get to the positions, soldiers have to walk on foot for five kilometers in the dead of night, with no sources of light, while carrying all of their incredibly heavy gear.</p><p>The positions themselves were ruins, with few places to hide. It's dangerous to stick a limb out from what cover remained, let alone go to the bathroom. Because the Russians in this area are relatively sharp, with professional troops and special forces in addition to conscripts from prisons or the general population. They’re well-screened and show little signs of fear.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><a class=""shortcodePatreonLight"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://kyivindependent.com/membership/?utm_source=article-top5-monthly&utm_medium=top5-banner"">

When the assault troops take a new position, the task falls on soldiers like Hutsul to move in and hold them over three-day shifts as Russian forces try to quickly take them back.</p><p>“The most important thing is to dig and entrench ourselves,” he said. </p><p>“Other guys gave their lives to take these positions, and now we have to hold them. If we don't dig in they could push us back out, and you don't want your brothers' lives to have been lost in vain.”</p><p>Blown to bits by months of heavy artillery fire, the positions they must hold often offer little cover. </p><p>“It's hard, you don't even have room to stretch out your legs, and you have to sit there for three days,” said Hutsul, who pointed to where shrapnel still remained lodged in his body after being wounded three times.  </p><p>“At an earlier position we were sent for three days and it ended up being five. Thirty-six degrees, and our water ran out, thankfully on the last day it rained and we had something to drink. We held those positions, by the way, and now we are going forward.” </p><figure class=""kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide""><div class=""swiper""><div class=""swiper-pagination""></div><div class=""swiper-button-prev""></div><div class=""swiper-button-next""></div><div class=""swiper-wrapper""><div class=""swiper-slide""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/DSCF9374.jpg"" width=""1240"" height=""827"" loading=""lazy"" alt><figcaption>Ukrainian infantrymen look up to deputy company commander Oleksandr Bondar during assault training in Donetsk Oblast on Aug. 5, 2023.

Inside, the six passengers are silent: Even if they have done this dozens of times before, the tension of the ride out is never lost completely.</p><p>The Kyiv Independent joined a five-man artillery crew for a 24-hour shift at positions just six kilometers west of Bakhmut itself, in an area where the front line has largely stood still despite months of heavy fighting. </p><p>The chorus of both sides’ exchange of artillery fire at these positions is endless, intensifying in the afternoon to the point where the whistle of an incoming shell comes like clockwork about a minute apart. Desensitized to the sound, both soldiers and local cats are unfazed even as the blasts shake the walls of the house where they are based.</p><figure class=""kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide""><div class=""swiper""><div class=""swiper-pagination""></div><div class=""swiper-button-prev""></div><div class=""swiper-button-next""></div><div class=""swiper-wrapper""><div class=""swiper-slide""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/DSCF9767.jpg"" width=""1240"" height=""826"" loading=""lazy"" alt><figcaption>Ukrainian artillery commander Zuba holding a 100mm shell at a position in Donetsk Oblast on Aug. 9, 2023.

The weapon is a relic of another era, outmatched in power, range, and accuracy by almost every other large artillery piece used in the war.</p><p>Here, however, the Rapira has found its niche. Firing from concealed positions at a range of up to eight kilometers, the weapon’s flat trajectory is ideal for targeting Russian snipers and anti-tank squads spotted working out of Bakhmut’s mangled apartment buildings.</p><p>This time, the crew’s hands are largely tied. Collecting the shells from two firing positions under cover of darkness, the shift commander Serhii “Zuba,” 30, finds that there are only 13 100mm shells left to use, with more only arriving with the shift change. </p><p>“It's always good to have some (ammunition) in reserve,” he said.</p><p>“Three days ago, the Russians assaulted and took some of our positions and we hit them with everything we had. Howitzers, mortars, we were all working together, just levelling where they were and that day we took the positions back. A good result.”</p><p>Forced to fire from close behind the front line due to the Rapira’s limitations, the crew here are especially vulnerable to Russian counterbattery fire. </p><p>Five days earlier, another shift on the same position had been targeted with poison gas munitions, leaving the crew hospitalized with internal chemical burns in their airways. Now, the team is equipped with gas masks, most of which themselves are relics from Soviet stocks.</p><p>Russia’s limited use of <a href=""https://kyivindependent.com/commander-russia-continues-to-use-chemical-weapons-in-ukraine/"">chemical weapons</a> on the battlefield in Ukraine, a blatant violation of the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention to which Russia is a signatory, is one of the least-discussed of Moscow’s war crimes due to a lack of independently verifiable evidence.</p><p>Beyond the fear factor for those subject to a chemical attack, the gas is particularly deadly when coordinated with regular artillery fire, as it descends into the basements and dugouts where soldiers would normally take shelter from explosions and shrapnel at ground level.</p><figure class=""kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-full kg-card-hascaption""><div class=""kg-gallery-container""><div class=""kg-gallery-row""><div class=""kg-gallery-image""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/DSCF9748.jpg"" width=""1240"" height=""827"" loading=""lazy"" alt></div><div class=""kg-gallery-image""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/DSCF9820.jpg"" width=""1240"" height=""827"" loading=""lazy"" alt></div></div></div><figcaption>Ukrainian artillerymen at a position in Donetsk Oblast on Aug. 9, 2023.

Sprawled over couches and beds, the soldiers alternated between getting some sleep and scrolling through social media to spend the time.</p><p>Armed with a few dozen more shells, the next shift successfully eliminated a Russian anti-tank position inside Bakhmut, one artilleryman told the Kyiv Independent by voice message later.</p><p>“It will be a long slog,” said Zuba of his outlook on the war. </p><p>“It's like a wall, it (the front line) has been standing here for so long, how long we've been fighting for this f***ing Bakhmut.

This is his first opportunity to swim this summer, prevented as he was earlier by his healing shrapnel wounds. </p><p>By the evening, the young soldier seems less nervous than before, his mind on the task ahead, despite annoyance at the news that he has been assigned to carry and use the cumbersome machine gun.</p><p>“I just want the war to end. If we have to sit through another winter, it will be sh*t,” Hutsul said. “One winter was enough for me; it's really cold, your feet freeze... and the bastards are assaulting you.”</p><p>“My dream... well I've never been to Crimea, I've lived in Ukraine all my life but I haven't been, it's really beautiful there. God willing, we'll go there.”</p><p>Hutsul returned from the mission with concussion from nearby shell bursts, but was otherwise unharmed. After a few days on a fluid drip, he was back on duty. </p><p>As summer draws to a close and Ukraine celebrates its second Independence Day in times of the full-scale invasion, the war itself has reached an onimous stage. </p><p>Whatever gains the southern counteroffensive makes before culmination, both sides look set for a gruelling struggle that could last for years more. </p><p>Eighteen months in, concern is mounting among soldiers, from commanders to the rank and file, that for much of the country’s civilian population, the war is increasingly fading into the distance, even as the fighting shows no signs of dying down.</p><figure class=""kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/DSCF9501.jpg"" class=""kg-image"" alt loading=""lazy""><figcaption>Late Ukrainian Volunteer Army commander Serhii Ilnytskyi types on his phone in Donetsk Oblast on Aug. 5, 2023.

      <p><strong>Hroza, Kharkiv Oblast - </strong>Serhii Pletinka rushed to the scene just after a Russian Iskander-M missile struck a packed cafe in the village of <a href=""https://kyivindependent.com/governor-russian-attack-on-kharkiv-oblast-village-kills-49-including-6-year-old-child/"">Hroza in Kharkiv Oblast</a>. </p><p>A soldier on vacation who lives just across the street from the cafe was the first to witness the fire, screams, and bodies.</p><p>“I was thrown by the blast wave, but I immediately ran (to the scene of the attack). A woman was screaming. She had broken legs and was pinned down by a refrigerator. She didn't understand what was happening,” Serhii told the Kyiv Independent. </p><p>A Russian missile struck the cafe on Oct. 5, where around 60 people had come for the funeral reception of the fallen soldier after his reburial in a cemetery nearby. The strike killed at least 52 people, including a child, and injured six others in what is the <a href=""https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-kills-51-people-in-single-deadliest-attack-against-civilians-this-year/"">deadliest attack</a> against civilians in Ukraine in 2023. </p><p>This was the first strike on the village during the full-scale invasion. Villagers and the law enforcement agency investigating the Russian attack believe that someone among the locals may have informed Russian forces about the funeral, which was supposed to involve military personnel. </p><p>The village of Hroza had a pre-war population of around 300 residents. Since many have fled since the start of the full-scale invasion, the attack killed roughly half of the residents who have stayed. </p><p>“We rescued only five people.

      <p>In March 2022 right after the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, a cell phone video apparently taken by a Russian soldier captured two “Zemledeliye” mobile mine-laying systems thought to be stationed in Kharkiv Oblast. </p><p>Positioned against a drab backdrop of what was once farmland, the “Zemledeliyes,” a word that means “agriculture” in Russian, could, on a very gloomy day, be mistaken for farm equipment. And indeed, these machines have been brought to “sow” Ukrainian fields. </p><p>A second into the video, the mine-laying systems begin firing. They are quickly engulfed in smoke, the launcher swallowed up so completely that even its silhouette vanishes. Deep in the billowing cloud, flashes of white light keep time with the ignition of each 122mm rocket as it screeches skywards. The landscape is engulfed as the launchers settle into their keening, mechanical rhythm.</p><p>In one minute and 13 seconds, all 100 rockets have been spent. Each rocket, fully loaded, carries 312 PFM-1 “Butterfly” anti-personnel mines. The mines are green or olive in color, and recognizable by their distinctive shape, similar to the “propellor” seeds that spiral down from maple, ash, and sycamore trees. </p><p>They are exceptionally small and light: just five inches end-to-end with plastic shells and only 40 grams of explosive per “Butterfly.”</p><p>Somewhere between five and fifteen kilometers away — the launchers’ optimal range — around 31,200 landmines are spinning to Earth. In less than a minute, the two mine launchers have knitted together a minefield in the sky and dropped it over Ukrainian soil like a net.</p><p>Forty grams of explosive in a light plastic casing is not usually enough to kill but is enough to take a foot or a hand from a fighter. After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, they became better known for their injurious effects on the curious children who would find them while out playing.</p><figure class=""kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1537013.jpg"" class=""kg-image"" alt loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""686""><figcaption>PFM-1 “Butterfly” mines lay strewn on the ground April 29, 2002 at the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Russia has been using these difficult-to-detect mines in its war against Ukraine. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure><p>In December 2022, Human Rights Watch (HRW) confirmed that, with eerie symmetry, Russia was using both 13 models of anti-personnel and 13 models of anti-vehicle landmines in its invasion of Ukraine, and that approximately 30% of the country — an area twice the size of Austria — had been “contaminated” with mines.</p><p>Speaking to the Kyiv Independent nine months later, HRW Associate Director, Mark Hiznay, explained the near impossibility of keeping that figure current.</p><p>“We are dealing with estimates that are being drawn up in an emergency situation where hostilities are ongoing,” Hiznay explains. </p><p>Put simply: It’s hard to count landmines through a storm of bullets and shell fragments.</p><p>What is known is that Russia, at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, had a stockpile of 26 million mines —the largest in the world, according to various estimates. With one vehicle able to place 15,600 mines in a single salvo, what percentage of that number now sits buried in Ukrainian soil, gathering silt in its lakes, or floating down its rivers is impossible to assess. </p><p>Jon Cunliffe, of the Mines Advisory Group (MAG), an international humanitarian organization that not only provides modern demining technology and training to afflicted countries but also extensive education programs for their citizens via in-person training sessions and through national media, agrees, adding:</p><p>“What is the point of clearing somewhere, only to have to go back and re-clear that area again later?”</p><h3 id=""an-evolving-threat""><code>An evolving threat</code></h3><p>Mine clearance, according to both Cunliffe and his MAG colleague, Jon Brown, is an extremely slow, painstaking process. As MAG is a humanitarian organization, it does not operate in active combat zones, but military deminers have long been priority targets for troops protecting minefields.</p><p>Since the First World War, landmines have been frequently booby-trapped and special bounties were offered for the killing of improvised explosive device (IED) specialists in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, while a team of specialists might have suffered casualties while clearing a minefield in the Second World War, that field — or at least, a path through it — was clear. </p><p>“Traditionally, the World War II mentality was that all of these mines are going to be buried by hand, in front of you, facing targets that are in close proximity. You know the targets are going to be armored vehicles so you can start putting the “dinner plates” (Hiznay’s term for the heavy, old-fashioned mines of the same shape) out in patterns that either deter someone from entering or encourage them to enter a piece of terrain,” Hiznay explains.</p><p>“(Since) the Cold War, that (ability) to place mines by rockets or by aircraft… means you’re able to now do that from 20 kilometers away.”</p><p>Further complicating humanitarian mine-clearing efforts is the sheer variety of mines that Russia is using. </p><p>There is more than just the PFM-1 “Butterfly,” historically referred to as the “green parrot.”</p><figure class=""kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1676185824--1-.jpg"" class=""kg-image"" alt loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""683""><figcaption>A man using a remote control demonstrates an up-armored excavator for demining purposes, in Kryvyi Rig on Sept.15, 2023, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

(Photo by Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure><p>The OZM-72 —  a “bounding” mine usually triggered by pressure or a tripwire that jumps (or “bounds”) a meter into the air before exploding — looks like a paint can attached to a radio antenna. </p><p>The POM-3 — probably Russia’s rarest and most expensive anti-personnel mine — modestly hides its seismic sensor and bounding explosive charge inside what could be a misplaced Thermos flask.</p><p>Simply put: landmines don’t look like landmines anymore.</p><p>“Most people (if asked to) draw a landmine, they will draw that classic landmine shape: round with a bit raised in the center,” says Cunliffe. “They will not draw the equivalent of a Butterfly. And so that is why there is such an effort in terms of explosive risk education going on.”</p><p>To date, 164 countries are signatories to the 1997 “Ottawa Treaty” (more popularly known as “the Mine Ban Treaty,”) which bans the use, production, and stockpiling of anti-personnel mines, primarily due to their lasting threat to “defenseless civilians and especially children.”</p><p>But Russia is not a signatory of the treaty. While the vast majority of countries have spent years disassembling and destroying their stockpiles of landmines, Russia’s military-industrial complex has been pouring money into R&amp;D programs to create ever-deadlier mines that citizens of Ukraine — which signed on February 24th, 1999 — would have no earthly reason to recognize, let alone proportionately fear.<br></p><h3 id=""fighting-back-from-dogs-to-drones""><code>Fighting back: From dogs to drones</code></h3><p>In Ukraine, two charities in particular - MAG and the HALO Trust - are working to educate, train, and provide for civilians and new Ukrainian demining teams.

Other government critics accuse trading firms linked to the state or Law and Justice lawmakers of aggravating the crisis, saying they failed to ship Ukrainian grain out of Poland in a timely manner.</p><p>Polish analysts have for weeks warned that Law and Justice could turn to anti-Ukrainian rhetoric as it tries to hold on to power.</p><p>Adam Leszczynski, a journalist with the Oko.press news portal who covers domestic politics and Polish-Ukrainian relations, said that the election may be decided by the thinnest of margins.</p><p>This year, Law and Justice is fending off not just liberal and leftist opposition but also a far-right challenger, Confederation party.</p><p>The far-right party has for months slammed the government as “naive” for offering Kyiv military and political backing, seemingly with no strings attached, and urged a strictly transactional approach.</p><p>The Confederation also seeks to capitalize on some Poles’ resentment of Warsaw’s decision to offer Ukrainian refugees a full social security and benefits package.

He said that the outpouring of support for Ukraine that followed was chiefly driven by Warsaw’s desire to counter Moscow and fears of possible Russian aggression against Poland itself in the future.</p><p>“Fear of Russia, the presence of a fundemental Russian threat, remain factors that lead both Polish elites and society to think Ukrainians can’t be left to fend for themselves,” he said.</p><h3 id=""spiral-of-past-grievances""><code>Spiral of past grievances</code></h3><p>Since coming to power in 2015, Law and Justice has been accused of weaponizing nationalist and Catholic sentiment to stifle civil society and weaken the rule of law.

This year, Law and Justice have leaned heavily into anti-German rhetoric, playing on older people’s World War II scars and appearing to cast EU institutions as an instrument of Berlin’s power.</p><p>A campaign ad aired last month portrays previous Polish governments as having taken instructions from Germany in domestic matters, such as raising the retirement age.

Other minorities, such as Jews and Czechs, were also targeted.</p><p>The massacres were followed by killings of several thousand Ukrainians by the Polish underground in what’s now eastern Poland, including a March 1944 massacre in the village of Sahryn.</p><p>Some Ukrainian historians, notably Volodymyr Vyatrovych, have disputed whether the killings of Poles were premeditated or organized – although the topic is far less widely discussed in Ukraine than in Poland.</p><p>On June 19, Jablonski threatened that Poland would not agree to Ukraine’s EU accession “unless the question of genocide in Volhynia is resolved.”</p><p>Lukasz Adamski, deputy director of a think tank set up by the Polish culture ministry to help develop relations with Ukraine and other Eastern European states, said that Kyiv’s refusal so far to allow the exhumation and burial of the Polish victims has been a key point of contention, regardless of who is in charge in Warsaw.</p><p>Adamski, of the Warsaw-based Juliusz Mieroszewski Centre for Dialogue, said Polish partisans are responsible for reprisal killings, such as those in Sahryn, but said that “the victims have graves in Poland, unlike in Ukraine. That’s what provokes such heated reactions.”</p><p>In mid-July 2018, on the 75 anniversary of the massacres, Polish news outlets ran photos of President Andrzej Duda laying flowers at the edge of a rippling wheat field in Volhynia, where a Polish village used to stand.</p><figure class=""kg-card kg-bookmark-card""><a class=""kg-bookmark-container"" href=""https://kyivindependent.com/slawomir-sierakowski-polands-destructive-grievance-politics/""><div class=""kg-bookmark-content""><div class=""kg-bookmark-title"">Sławomir Sierakowski: Poland’s destructive grievance politics</div><div class=""kg-bookmark-description"">Even though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently honored the victims of a 1943 massacre of Poles by Ukrainian nationalists, some Poles still think their country is owed an apology.

The authorities highlighted their fight against Ukraine’s Soviet occupiers, with Poland and Poles largely outside the narrative.</p><p>Amid Russia’s brutal invasion, Bandera’s approval rating appears to have reached unprecedented highs: A January poll by Rating, a Ukrainian sociological agency, indicated that 74 percent of respondents held positive views of him in April 2022, a striking increase from 22 percent in 2012.</p><p>But UPA and OUN members, including Shukhevych, have also been implicated in the massacres of Poles, and the two organizations’ names carry strongly negative connotations in Poland.</p><p>Adamski said Poland’s ruling party is keenly aware of competition from the far-right Confederation, which likewise stresses “national honor” and historical grievances, and said it is a likely reason why the Volhynia issue has resurfaced.</p><p>He said there were “objective problems” in Polish-Ukrainian relations, such as the exhumation ban or “a lack of understanding” among Poles why figures such as Bandera or Shukhevych were increasingly cast in a heroic light in Ukraine.</p><p>“However, these problems would not be highlighted in the same way if not for the electoral campaign,” Adamski said.</p><p>Balcer commented that anti-Ukrainian rhetoric from Law and Justice has often gone hand in hand with the anti-German slogans prominent in the party’s campaign messaging.</p><p>“Law and Justice’s anti-Ukrainian rhetoric has gone hand in hand with its anti-EU and anti-German slogans,” he said.</p><p>In August, one of Poland’s largest dailies ran an interview with Witold Waszczykowski, a Law and Justice politician and Poland’s former top diplomat, who alleged that Kyiv had “allied itself with Germany” over the grain issue.</p><p>Weeks prior, Deputy Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of the Law and Justice party, likened the Volhynia and east Galicia massacres to Nazi crimes.</p><p>Senior Ukrainian officials have addressed the issue of the massacres earlier this year.</p><p>Ukrainian parliament Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk told the Polish parliament in May that Warsaw and Kyiv will work together towards reconciliation, “accepting the truth no matter how ruthless it may be.”</p><p>His words prompted applause from Polish lawmakers.

Of course, I would really like Ukrainians to admit that they also committed crimes, but the problem in Poland is that we don’t want to allow any nuance in our own narrative. This is not a story where Poles are solely victims and Ukrainians, solely perpetrators,” Balcer said.</p><p>The Polish government has bemoaned the adoption by Kyiv in 2015 of controversial “decommunization” laws, one of which outlaws the “denial and disrespect” of the role in Ukrainian history of a long list of figures, ranging from human rights activists to UPA militants, some of whom Poland accuses of ethnic cleansing.</p><p>Less than three years later, Poland, too, adopted a fiercely contested “Holocaust bill” mandating fines or imprisonment for those who alleged that ethnic Poles were complicit in Nazi Germany’s crimes.</p><p>Balcer argued that Warsaw needs to learn to address painful episodes from Poland’s own history, including individual Poles’ collaboration with the Nazis during the Holocaust, but also the murders of Ukrainian civilians by Polish partisans in the 1940s, as well as the Polish state’s often unequal treatment of its Ukrainian inhabitants over the centuries.</p><p>Journalist Leszczynski said that while he would “not point to Poland as an example” of how to reckon with history, he hoped that Ukraine’s integration into the European community would prompt greater readiness to confront its darker turns.</p><p>“It’s an incredibly difficult task that we in Poland have only partially worked through, with respect to Polish-Jewish but also Polish-Ukrainian relations. It’s a matter of understanding that strong nations face up to their past, including its dark sides, while weak nations resist this,” he said.</p><p>Leszczynski said that while he would like Ukrainian authorities to apologize for the massacres, he didn’t think that “anyone reasonable in Poland should demand this now, during the war with Russia.”</p><p>Balcer, Adamski, and Leszczynski all said the anti-Ukrainian rhetoric coming from the Law and Justice party is part of the ongoing electoral campaign, adding that military support for Kyiv and a full Ukrainian victory over Russia lie in Poland’s strategic interests.</p><p>Leszczynski said he was unsurprised that Law and Justice would risk the relationship with Ukraine to secure a domestic win.</p><p>“(The government) will sacrifice as much as it possibly can, in terms of foreign relations, to win in Poland. They’ve done it repeatedly before, whether it came to relations with Israel or the EU,” he said.</p>

      <p>With the Polish parliamentary elections just around the corner, the country's rising far-right threaten Poland's relations with Ukraine in more ways than one.<br><br>The Confederation party, a contender for third place in the upcoming Oct. 15 elections, is a disrupting force that pushes the country's mainstream further and further to the fringe, setting the tone for Polish foreign policy.</p><p>Traditionally Kyiv’s most ardent and vocal ally, the Polish government’s relationship with Ukraine has been recently marred by diplomatic spats and trade disputes.</p><p>The ruling right-wing Law and Justice party (PiS) is not only putting its foot down on Ukrainian grain imports but also chastises Kyiv for an apparent lack of gratitude for Polish support and plays on painful historical grievances.</p><p>This seemingly sudden change is not without cause – PiS is feeling the pressure of the Confederation, a far-right alliance fighting for the same voters and capitalizing on the creeping Ukraine fatigue.</p><p>At one point surging as high as 14% and, in the more recent polls, oscillating around 10%, some surveys place the ""nationalist-libertarian coalition"" party as potentially the third strongest candidate behind PiS's United Right coalition (≈37%) and the liberal Civic Coalition/Civic Platform (≈30%).</p><p>To halt the spilling of its voters to the more radical and hardline Confederation, PiS is forced to “up the ante” in its “Poland first” rhetoric and convince a significant part of its voter base that Law and Justice can protect their interests better than the far-right upstarts.</p><p>The ruling conservatives must also consider that the Confederation’s MPs may hold keys to the next government.

      <p>The specter of Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy system looms once again as winter rapidly approaches.</p><p>Last year in early October, just as Ukraine’s heating season began, Russia launched a month-long series of missile and drone attacks against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, leading to blackouts amid freezing temperatures and electricity rationing.</p><p>The attacks damaged <a href=""https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/07/8/7410468/"">half of the country’s energy system</a>, Ukrainian officials said. </p><p>So when Russia carried out a wave of attacks on energy facilities in western and central Ukraine on Sept. 21, the first of this kind of attack in six months, it caused fears that Russia was gearing up to inflict similar damage on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure this heating season. </p><p>While it is unknown if the Sept. 21 attack is the first in a series of renewed attacks, Ukraine’s energy companies and experts are confident Russia will again resort to the same tactics this year.</p><p>“There is no doubt that Russia will resort to energy terrorism once again,” Antonina Antosha, spokesperson for the country’s largest private energy company DTEK, told the Kyiv Independent. </p><p>Since last winter, the country has worked to repair the damage done last year and acquired more air defenses to protect its infrastructure from future attacks while stocking up on energy resources, Kostyantin Krysnytskyi from the NGO Ekodia told the Kyiv Independent.</p><p>“We will need all the capacities that we have: coal, gas, renewables, nuclear, everything,” he said.</p><p>But even if Ukraine has enough of the resources it needs, a cold winter and Russian attacks could once again put the country’s energy system to the test. </p><figure class=""kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption""><img src=""https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1244529896.jpg"" class=""kg-image"" alt loading=""lazy"" width=""7814"" height=""5212""><figcaption>A ferris wheel is lit as sporadic power cuts leave parts of the city in darkness on Nov. 5, 2022 in Kyiv.
